standard, transfer, and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of 
this implementation of DreamWorks Lossy Compression within the OpenEXR standard,

Animation that are necessarily infringed by this implementation of DreamWorks 
Lossy Compression. This grant does not include use of DreamWorks Lossy 
Compression outside of the OpenEXR standard. This grant does not include claims
that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of this

a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that this implementation 
of DreamWorks Lossy Compression or any code incorporated within this 
implementation of DreamWorks Lossy Compression constitutes direct or 
contributory patent infringement, or inducement of patent infringement, then 
any patent rights granted to you under this License for this implementation 
of DreamWorks Lossy Compression shall terminate as of the date such litigation
is filed.
